## Run it

Clone me

    git clone git@github.com:garaekz/ricknmortapp.git

Locate yourself inside the folder

    cd ricknmortapp
Install dependencies

    yarn install
Run the dev server

    yarn dev
This will run the dev server at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

## Test it
Well... How can I put this... At this moment I don't have set up unit or E2E tests, maybe in future releases.

## Build it

So, you want to deploy this? I got your back, just run:

    yarn build
